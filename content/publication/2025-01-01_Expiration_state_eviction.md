abstract = "Goal: Housing insecurity is associated with poor perinatal outcomes. However, we lack information on whether supportive housing policies improve perinatal health. Our goal was to estimate the effect of expiration of a state-level eviction moratoria on adverse maternal and infant outcomes among Medicaid insured individuals residing in states with a state-level moratorium in place at conception in the United States.  Methods: We used data from the US natality files, 2020–2022 and the Eviction Moratoria & Housing Policy dataset to link individuals with moratoria. We compared those for whom the moratorium expired prior to conception, in the first trimester, or second trimester (exposed) with those fully protected through gestation (unexposed) We fit log binomial models to estimated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome separately (preterm birth (PTB), very preterm birth (VPTB), low birthweight birth (LBW), very low birthweight birth (VLBW), primary cesarean, maternal morbidity, or adequate/adequate plus prenatal care utilization) using generalized estimating equations, controlling for month/year of conception, state (unemployment, monthly covid death rates per 100,000, median household income, governor's party affiliation 2019), and individual (primiparity, age, race/ethnicity) confounders. We also fit difference in difference models as an alternate approach.  Results: We included 2,562,067 births (PTB: 12.5%, LBW: 8.1%, primary cesarean:14.1%). All adverse outcomes were more common for births where the moratoria expired prior to conception or during the first trimester. Following adjustment, risk remained significantly elevated for primary cesarean (preconception v. fully protected: RR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.14; first trimester: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.11) but not other outcomes. Results from difference in difference models were consistent with multilevel models.  Conclusions: Expiration of an eviction moratoria during the first or second trimester of pregnancy was not associated with increased risk of adverse birth outcomes, beyond ongoing state and temporal factors for people birthing in the United States during the COVID-19 global pandemic."
