abstract = "Men comprise a small fraction of the nurse labor force, yet across the distribution of wages, male nurses earn more than female nurses. In this paper, we use nurse survey data to decompose the sex-based wage gap and to explore why male nurses earn a premium in a female-dominated profession. We consider the role of traditional factors such as human capital and family structure, along with explanations that are more specific to nursing. Results indicate that overtime pay is a significant factor, particularly among hospital workers, but otherwise, after accounting for an extensive set of job-related characteristics, the wage gap persists."
