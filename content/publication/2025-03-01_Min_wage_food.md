abstract = "Are increases in the US state minimum wage associated with reduced food insecurity among economically at-risk households with children?  In this pooled cross-sectional study using repeated surveys from 2005 to 2022 from a nationally representative sample of US households, more generous state minimum wage policies were associated with significant reductions in household food insecurity. At the federal minimum wage, the estimated level of food insecurity was 9.9%, whereas at the highest state minimum wage the estimated rate was 6.8%.  This study suggests that more generous state minimum wage policies may reduce food insecurity among households with children at risk for economic hardship."
