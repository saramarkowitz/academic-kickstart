abstract = "The demand for healthcare professionals is predicted to grow significantly over the next decade. Securing an adequate workforce is of primary importance to ensure the health and wellbeing of the population in an efficient manner. Occupational licensing laws and related restrictions on scope of practice (SOP) are features of the market for healthcare professionals and are also controversial. At issue is a balance between protecting the public health and removing anticompetitive barriers to entry and practice. In this paper, we examine the case of SOP restrictions for certified nurse midwives (CNMs) and evaluate the effects of changes in states’ SOP laws on markets for CNMs and on maternal and infant outcomes. We find that SOP laws are neither helpful nor harmful in regards to health outcomes but states that have no SOP-based barriers have lower rates of induced labor and Cesarean section births. We discuss the implications for state policy."
