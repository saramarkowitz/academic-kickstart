abstract = "This paper estimates the effects of higher cigarette prices and smoke-free policies on the prevalence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Using a panel of developed countries over a 20 year period, we find that higher cigarette prices are associated with reductions in the prevalence of SIDS. However, we find no evidence that smoke-free policies are associated with declines in SIDS."
